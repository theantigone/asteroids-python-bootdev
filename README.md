## Overview

This simple video game is a guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python). This is based on the classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ installed
- The [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) project/package manager
- Access to a Unix-like shell (e.g., `zsh` or `bash`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to it in your filesystem

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theantigone/asteroids-python-bootdev.git
cd asteroids-python-bootdev
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and activate it

```sh
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use a `fish` shell, run the `activate.fish` script:
> ```sh
> source .venv/bin/activate.fish
> ```
> For Windows, use a different syntax:
> ```sh
> source .\venv\bin\Activate.ps1
> ```

3. Ensure `pygame` is installed:

```sh
uv run -m pygame
```

4. Run the `main.py` script from the command line

```sh
uv run main.py
```

## Usage Examples

## Troubleshooting

You can always peer into the source code to debug any issues.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy my guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev)!
